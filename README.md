# nlp_location_extractor
Takes a natural language text input (like a sentence).  Extracts location names (e.g., cities, areas, countries) from that input.  Uses SpaCy's Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify locations labeled as GPE (Geo-Political Entity) or LOC (Location).

Location Extractor - NLP Application
A Python-based Natural Language Processing application that uses SpaCy to extract location entities from natural language text. This project identifies and extracts location names (cities, countries, regions) from input text using Named Entity Recognition (NER).

ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview
This project implements a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system using SpaCy to extract location entities from text input. The solution is enhanced with custom location patterns to ensure specific locations like "Baner", "Wakad", and "Hinjewadi" are reliably recognized even when they might not be in standard NLP models.

This application takes natural language prompts and identifies locations mentioned in the input text. For example:

Input: "List properties in Baner and Wakad"
Output: ["Baner", "Wakad"]

The project uses SpaCy's pre-trained models and Named Entity Recognition capabilities to identify entities labeled as GPE (Geopolitical entities) and LOC (Locations).

ðŸš€ Features

1.Location Extraction: Identifies and extracts location names from text
2.Multiple Output Formats: Simple list, detailed information, or JSON format
3.Command Line Interface: Easy-to-use CLI with multiple operation modes
4.Interactive Mode: Real-time location extraction with user input
5.Batch Processing: Process multiple texts from files
6.Comprehensive Testing: Unit tests with mocking for reliable functionality
7.Clean Code Structure: Modular, readable Python code following best practices

Location Extractor - NLP Application
A Python-based Natural Language Processing application that uses SpaCy to extract location entities from natural language text. This project identifies and extracts location names (cities, countries, regions) from input text using Named Entity Recognition (NER).

ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview
This solution implements a custom-trained spaCy model for specialized location entity extraction. Unlike generic NLP models, this system is specifically trained to recognize location entities in real estate contexts, combining both standard global locations and custom local areas.

ðŸš€ Features:

Custom Model Training: Creates a specialized NLP model from scratch

Location Focus: Optimized exclusively for location recognition (LOC entities)

Case Insensitivity: Handles all case variations automatically

Hybrid Recognition: Identifies both predefined and custom locations

Efficient Workflow: Trains once on first run, then loads instantly

Comprehensive Testing: Includes unit tests for core functionality

The system solves the problem of reliably extracting location mentions from user queries, particularly important for real estate applications where location names may be local and not present in standard NLP models.
This application takes natural language prompts and identifies locations mentioned in the input text. For example:

Input: "List properties in Baner and Wakad"
Output: ["Baner", "Wakad"]

Running the Application

First Run (Trains the Model)

python main.py

> Automatically trains the model (takes 1-2 minutes)

> Creates trained_model directory

> Subsequent runs use the trained model

Normal Execution
    python main.py

Sample session:
