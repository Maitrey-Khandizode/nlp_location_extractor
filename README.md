# nlp_location_extractor
Takes a natural language text input (like a sentence).  Extracts location names (e.g., cities, areas, countries) from that input.  Uses SpaCy's Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify locations labeled as GPE (Geo-Political Entity) or LOC (Location).

Location Extractor - NLP Application
A Python-based Natural Language Processing application that uses SpaCy to extract location entities from natural language text. This project identifies and extracts location names (cities, countries, regions) from input text using Named Entity Recognition (NER).

ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview
This solution implements a custom-trained spaCy model for specialized location entity extraction. Unlike generic NLP models, this system is specifically trained to recognize location entities in real estate contexts, combining both standard global locations and custom local areas.

ðŸš€ Features:

Custom Model Training: Creates a specialized NLP model from scratch

Location Focus: Optimized exclusively for location recognition (LOC entities)

Case Insensitivity: Handles all case variations automatically

Hybrid Recognition: Identifies both predefined and custom locations

Efficient Workflow: Trains once on first run, then loads instantly

Comprehensive Testing: Includes unit tests for core functionality

The system solves the problem of reliably extracting location mentions from user queries, particularly important for real estate applications where location names may be local and not present in standard NLP models.
This application takes natural language prompts and identifies locations mentioned in the input text. For example:

Input: "List properties in Baner and Wakad"
Output: ["Baner", "Wakad"]



Installation

Python 3.10+
pip package manager

SetUp:-

Step 1 :- Create and activate a virtual environment 
        conda -p venv python == 3.13.4
    To Activate the Environment
        .venv\Scripts\activate

Step 2 :-  Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Application

First Run (Trains the Model)

python main.py

> Automatically trains the model (takes 1-2 minutes)

> Creates trained_model directory

> Subsequent runs use the trained model

Normal Execution
    python main.py

Sample session:


Location Extractor NLP Application
Enter text prompt (type 'exit' to quit):

Input: Show properties in baner and wakad
Locations found: baner, wakad

Input: Compare Viman Nagar with Kharadi
Locations found: Viman Nagar, Kharadi

Input: What about New York?
Locations found: New York

Input: Schedule meeting with John
No locations found

Input: exit

Sample Input/Output
Input Text	                                   Output Locations
"Visit Paris and Berlin"	                    Paris, Berlin
"Show properties in Baner and Wakad"	        Baner, Wakad
"Offices in New York"                          	New York
"Schedule meeting with John"	                No locations found
"Compare Kharadi and Viman Nagar"	            Kharadi, Viman Nagar
